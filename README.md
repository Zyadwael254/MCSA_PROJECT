Recently completed a hands-on Windows Server project with a clear and structured PowerPoint documentation.

The goal was to simulate a real production workflow:
configuring the server, setting up roles & features, and delivering a concise technical presentation that highlights the entire process.

This project helped me organize my approach to System Administration, and the documentation was the key part — it shows exactly what was done and why.

The PowerPoint is clean, straight to the point, and covers everything a Systems Engineer needs before applying the setup.
